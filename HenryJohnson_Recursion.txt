1. How many calls to factorial() occur when the initial input is some value x?
factorial() will call itself x times, and it would also be called one initial time.

2. What is the base case for the babylon() function?
if (abs(next_guess - guess) < 1.0e-10) return guess;

3. What mathematical function of n and k is computed by what_does_it_do()?
it takes n to the power of k.

4. What was the error in the permutations() function, and how did you fix it?
the issue in the permutaions() function is that when it is called in the line 
set<string> suffixes = permutations(rest);
it will then keep asking for permutations of the rest of the given string.
the issue is that the rest of the string never gets added to suffix, so permutation(rest)
will keep getting called until there is nothing left in the string. this all means that the for loop
in which suffixes and s[i] are added to answer, never gets called. 
my solution to this was to add the line
suffixes.insert(rest);
just after the line:
set<string> suffixes = permutations(rest);
